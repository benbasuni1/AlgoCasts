# Notes

## Common String Questions
* What is the most common character in the string?
* Does A have the same characters as B (anagram?)
* Does the given string have any repeated characters in it?

## Runtime Complexity
* 1 for loop through single collection - O(n)
* For loop through half a collection - O(n)
* Iterating 2 different collections - O(n + m)
* 2 Nested for loops over 1 collection - O(n^2)
* 2 Nested for loop over 2 collections - O(n * m)
* Sorting - O(n log n)
* Searching a sorted array - O(log n)

## Queues
* Enqueue => Unshift
* Dequeue => Pop
